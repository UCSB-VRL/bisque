  <title>Plant cell tracking in 2D+T/3D+T</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Help and workflow</h2>
    
<p>This application allows you to select local file or an image in the Bisque database and automatically segment the plant cells with centroids identified in 2D+time/3D+time confocal microscopic imagery. These centroid locations and lineage infromation can be exported as text, excel file, XML or visualized overlayed on image. The segmentation and tracking resulsts can be used for additional analysis such as 3D reconstrcution and plant cell growth statistics modeling.</p>
    
    
    <p>The input image could be a number of images slices at different time instances or a number of image stacks at different time instances. You can choose the 2D region of interest by first clicking "rectangle" then "select" after you select the input image. Similarly, if the input is a stack of images slices or time series of image stacks, you can choose the 3D or 4D region of interest by picking the first 2D region of interest in the starting (either spatially or temporally) frame and the second 2D region of interest in the ending (either spatially or temporally) frame.</p>
