<h3>About:</h3>

<p>The Botanicam 3: The Plant Recognizer module can be used to identify bushes and leaves and find 
similar images in the users data set that match the tags of the image identify. To predict the tags 
for the image, the module creates either a bush classifier or a leaf classifier depending on the choice of the user. Once the classifiers 
have been calculated they are predicted with the model using support vector machines. The model is trained
in Botanicam: The Trainer with a different model for the different classifiers. To see what type of plants have been 
classified check the file dataset and search &quot;Dataset&quot;:&quot;Botanicam Model&quot; and  &quot;Classification Method&quot;:
and either &quot;Leaf Descriptor&quot; or &quot;Bush Descriptor.&quot; This module only retrieves the latest model to predict.
The annotation gives the tags and classes.</p>

<h3>How to Use:</h3>

<p>1. In the Select Data for Processing section there are 3 options:</p>
<p>a. Select an Image allows the user to pick an image from their
image collection on the Bisque server.<br/>
b. Select an example allows the user to test out the module with 
images that the developer has chosen which would work best with the module.<br/>
c. Upload local images which allows the user to select an image 
from their computer or other devices to use in the module.</p>
<p>Select one of the 3 options and select an image of a bush or leaf that you would
like to determine its classification. <i>Note: The leaf needs to be a scan to work correctly.</i></p>
<p>2. Once you have selected an image it will appear in a gobect.
A few option will be displayed above the image. If you would like to crop the image select Rectangle 
and click on the image. A red box will appear on the image. Click the select option and click on the 
box to drag the box to the region you want to crop. Select the corners and drag to re-size the region.
<i>Note: If you do not want to crop you can just move on to the next part without selecting Rectangle and
the entire image will be processed.</i></p>

<p>3. Now that you have your image, select the part of the plant in the
Parameters section you are analyzing in you image.</p>
<p>4. Click Run and the module will start processing the image. 
This will take a few minutes.</p>
<p>5. After the modules is done a detection summary will be given with 
a list of tags that the module thinks the image should be labeled. The module will also produce images
with the same tags in the similar images box.</p>
