<h3>About:</h3>

<p>Botanicam: The Trainer is a module that trains support vector machine models of a dataset.
The module can train two types of model. One is the Leaf descriptors which take scans of leaves and calculate descriptors
from the shape and texture and the other is a bush descriptor that calculates texture descriptors from bushes. The output
of this module is a zip file containing the model and a dictionary of all the tags used to classify the dataset. This file can be
used by Botanicam 3: The Plant Recognizer as the model file. </p>
