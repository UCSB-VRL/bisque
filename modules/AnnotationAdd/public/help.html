    <h2>Help</h2>
    <p>This module allows adding annotations to many images. If you select a dataset then the annotation will only be added to that dataset.
    Othewise the annotation will be added to all datasets.</p>

    <p>There are two types of annotations:</p>
    <p>Textual (Tag)</p>
    <p>Graphical (Gobject)</p>

    <p>Each annotation has a name, a value and a type. For example, if you want to store cell area you might use cell_area:235. In this case cell_area is the name of the annotation and 235 is its value. Type may be used to give semantic meaning to these annotations. For example, it can be used to give a meaning to the point as cell_nucleus.</p>
