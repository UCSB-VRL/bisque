<p>
This module implements a surrogate model that predicts effective yield strength of a composite given its 3-D microstructure.
</p>

<p>
The model is developed for composites with strength contrast of 5: strength of hard phase s2/s1 = 5. The model works best on periodic 3-D microstructures.
</p>
<p>
Calibration of the model is done by finite element simulation data by multivariate polynomial regression between principal component scores of 2-point statistics (representing microstructure) and effective yield strength (property). See more details in the paper, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999117304588" target="_blank">Data-driven reduced order models for effective yield strength and partitioning of strain in multiphase materials</a>.</p>
