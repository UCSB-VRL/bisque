PyLog
======

A local server that can receive log message from multiple processes.
Check the source code contrib/logging/loggingwebmonitor.py

Launch the loging server:
python contrib/logging/loggingwebmonitor.py bisque.log

As is it will open a WebServer at 0.0.0.0:9021 for log viewing






Syslog
======

Bisque can be configured to use syslog which is usefull 
for multiprocess logging.

Ever system seems to have a different syslog config.
In particular, you need to determine with syslog facility is
available i.e. local1 

You can then configure you syslog with 

local1.*               /var/log/bisque/bisque.log

An important point is that some "catch-all" facilities will now
get bisque message. You NEED to turn them off.

Exmaple:
The following catch-all send message to syslog

*.*;auth,authpriv.none	-/var/log/syslog

You will need to modify the line as such

*.*;user,local0,local1.none;auth,authpriv.none	-/var/log/syslog
