1. Download certificate from your SSL website.
  In chrome, click on lock icon in the left side in the browse bar
  Then select "Certificate information"
  Then "Details" and "Copy to file"

2. you need to update the cacerts file of the jre, which for me was located at: $Matlab/sys/java/jre/win64/jre/lib/security/cacerts

Use "protecle" to open cert store and to add the certificate using the default password: "changeit"
